# Ethical AI guidelines for reinforcing human-to-human relationships

These guidelines outline principles for deploying AI within a governance framework that prioritizes human collaboration and trust. They complement approaches such as the Paradox-Based Theory proposed by Jorge Pelarigo dos Santos.

## Principles

- **Human-centered design** – AI should augment rather than replace relationships. Systems must support empathy and cooperation.
- **Transparency** – Decisions made with AI must be explainable and accessible to those affected.
- **Accountability** – Maintain clear human responsibility for outcomes and allow auditability of AI decisions.
- **Inclusivity** – Protect cultural diversity and mitigate biases that could damage trust.
- **Privacy and security** – Safeguard personal data and provide user control over information.
- **Continuous evaluation** – Regularly review AI use for unintended consequences and update policies accordingly.

## Implementation tips

- Document decision-making processes and share them with relevant stakeholders.
- Provide training on ethical AI usage for teams and collaborators.
- Encourage open discussion of the social impact of AI deployments.
- Adapt governance policies in response to community feedback and new research.

Following these guidelines helps reinforce healthy human-to-human relationships while enabling responsible AI development.
